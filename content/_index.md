      text:
        I am a researcher in educational technology whose work explores how digital
        technologies reshape learning, teaching, and educational institutions. My
        research combines educational technology, learning sciences, feedback
        research, and critical perspectives on digital transformation.Current areas of interest include peer feedback and feedback literacy, open and networked learning, AI and misinformation in education, digital learning
        ecologies, and the societal implications of data-driven and platform-based
        education. Methodologically, my work spans empirical learning research,
        psychometric scale development, design-oriented research, and conceptual
        analyses of digital transformation in education.


        I am working as a full professor of educational technology and Chief
        Information/Chief Digital Officer (CIO/CDO) at the Heidelberg University of
        Education. I serve as associate editor of the International Journal of Artificial Intelligence
        in Education and editorial board member of the Journal of Computing in Higher Education.
        I am a senior-fellow of the Interuniversity Center for Educational Sciences (ICO) and the
        Dutch research school on information and knowledge systems (SIKS). I work as director of
        the study program E-Learning and Media Education and director of the Heidelberg Centre for
        Digital Transformation in Education. Over the years I could secure approx. 4 Mio EUR of research
        funding for my institutions from competitive projects with a total budget of 36 Mio EUR. 
        I have been an invited keynote speaker on more than 60 conferences and events. 
        Besides European projects I am regularly involved in educational innovation and consulting projects
        with partners inside and outside of my institutions including clients like the International Labour Organisation,
        United Nations Environment Program, the European Commission, UNESCO, OECD or other international and national organizations.
